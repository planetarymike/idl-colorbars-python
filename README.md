# idl-colorbars-python
This repo is some basic python wrapper code to get at the RGB values of some nice colormaps I designed for IDL [here](https://github.com/planetarymike/IDL-Colorbars). 

These were originally designed using colorspacious and theoretically this could be used directly to generate the colormaps in Python but I have the RGB values in text files so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Here's the list of colormaps:
