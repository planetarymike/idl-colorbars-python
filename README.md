# idl-colorbars-python
This repo is some basic python wrapper code to get at the RGB values of some nice colormaps I designed for IDL [here](https://github.com/planetarymike/IDL-Colorbars). 

These were originally designed using colorspacious and theoretically this could be used directly to generate the colormaps in Python but I have the RGB values in text files so ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Here's the list of colormaps:

If you want to use only a portion of a colormap then you can set vmin and vmax between 0 and 1 to select that portion of the range.
